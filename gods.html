            <p>
                <b>Gods</b> have played a huge role in the Norse Mythology. It's impossible to tell how many of them there were. Some sources will 
                go with number 9, in some texts we can see at least 20 mentioned, and the further we dig, the higher amount we get. In total there 
                might be even <b>hundreds</b> of them but, on the other hand, many of Gods were assigned to multiple names. That is because all the myths 
                were passed down orally.
            </p>

            <section id="about">
                <h2>About Gods</h2>
                <p>
                    Gods in the Norse Mythology were spiritual beings with human-like bodies and personalities but with unordinary powers. Many of them 
                    travelled throughout the world, and therefore could be seen by ordinary people, even when they didn't recognize them. For example, <a href="#odin">Odin</a> 
                    (<i>the Wanderer</i>) had tendency to travel through the land undercover and put people to the test. Sometimes he could be a rich merchant, 
                    other times poor rogue who needed help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From what we know, there were two groups of Gods - <a href="#aesir"><i>Aesir</i></a> (associated with war) and <a href="#vanir"><i>Vanir</i></a> 
                    (associated with nature). Each group has its own strong representatives and together they contributed to the common peace. However, this was achieved 
                    only after the bloody <i>Aesir-Vanir war</i>.
                </p>

                <section id="aesir">
                    <h2>Aesir</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gods from Aesir are considered as the <b>main</b> Gods. Its most known representatives are <a href="#odin"><i>Odin</i></a>, <i>Frigg</i> 
                        (or <a href="#freya"><i>Freya</i></a>*), <a href="#tyr"><i>Tyr</i></a>, <a href="#thor"><i>Thor</i></a>, <a href="#baldur"><i>Baldur</i></a>, <a href="#loki"><i>Loki</i></a>, 
                        <i>Jord</i> and <i>Heimdall</i>. They live together in <a href="nine_worlds.html#Asgard"><i>Asgard</i></a> and try to maintain 
                        peace and order within all words. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        *there is a conflict whether Frigg and Freya are or aren't the same person, I am personally more inclined to the version where they are, 
                        as it gives more sense to many stories
                    </p>

                <section id="vanir">
                    <h2>Vanir</h2>
                    <p>
                        The second group of Gods - Vanir, were associated mostly with <b>nature</b> and <b>fertility</b>. Their main representatives are 
                        <a href="#freya"><i>Freya</i></a>, <i>Freyr</i>, <i>Njord</i>, and <i>Nerthus</i>. They lived in <a href="nine_worlds.html#Vanaheim"><i>Vanaheim</i></a> 
                        - one of the nine worlds. It is not certain where exactly this place lies, as it is barely mentioned in the sources, but it is definitely not as highly 
                        placed as <a href="nine_worlds.html#Asgard">Asgard</a> is.

                            Odin is also knows as <i>All-father</i>, as he is the <b>main God</b> in the whole Mythology, <b>ruler of <a href="nine_worlds.html#Asgard">Asgard</a></b> 
                            and the <b>king of <a href="#aesir">Aesir</a></b>. He is considered as a God of wisdom, poetry and war and he has at least five children, from which the 
                            most popular one is <a href="#thor">Thor</a>. He is often depicted without an eye, with a long beard, wearing a hat or a hood (that was due to his wandering 
                            around the world) and with <a href="index.html#ravens"><i>Huginn</i> and <i>Munnin</i></a> on his shoulders. We can also see him riding an eight-legged horse 
                            called <i>Sleipnir</i> - one of <a href="#loki">Loki's</a> children.

                            Freya was <b>the most important</b> and <b>the most popular Goddess</b>  among both the Gods and ordinary people. She is a member of both <a href="#vanir"><i>Vanir</i></a> 
                            and <a href="#aesir"><i>Aesir</i></a>. She was a <b>wife of <a href="#odin">Odin</a></b>, the Goddess of love, fate, beauty and fertility. In the stories she is often depicted 
                            as a beautiful promiscuous woman that <b>can practice magic</b>, to which she introduced other Gods as well. She drove a chariot drawn by two cats and wore a cloak made 
                            of falcon feathers. Due to her magic abilities and her association with the destiny, she was <b>the most powerful Goddess</b> in the Norse Mythology.

                            This weapon is also considered as the most powerful in cosmos. He also possess a special belt of strength, that makes his already <b>unmatchable physical strength</b> 
                            even greater. He drove in his goat-driven chariot across the world and killed giants and often helped people. His biggest enemy is

                            is one of the most beautiful and most cheerful among the deities. In sagas he is often said to <b>give off the light</b>. However, many of them are only about his death. 
                            His only weakness is a mistletoe, what <a href="#loki">Loki</a> used to killed him. Apart from his beauty, he was very intelligent - he often dealt with disagreements between humans 
                            and Gods.

                My name is <i>Petra Petrusova</i> and I am an author of this website. I am from a small city in Slovakia and currently I am a Computer Science student 
                on <i>University College Cork</i> in Ireland. As you can see, my course is not related to the topic of this website, but I spent a lot of time 
                doing research on the Viking Age, as it is my favorite historic period. I have read a lot of stories and sagas, as well as encyclopedias and academic 
                texts.   
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole Mythology became my passion when I was on the primary school. My brother introduced me to the TV Series <i>Vikings</i> and I immediately 
                fell in love. Since then, I am constantly developing my knowledge, and the more I know, the more I find it interesting and beautiful. I still have 
                a lot of ground to cover, but I am already confident that this passion will stay with me throughout my whole life.
