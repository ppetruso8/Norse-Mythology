            <p>
                There are <b>nine realms</b> in the Norse Mythology, spreading out from the majestic tree <b><i>Yggdrasil</i></b>, that is in the centre of the universe.
                Some are on the branches, some in the roots. Their names are <a href="#Asgard"><i>Asgard</i></a>, <a href="#Alfheim"><i>Alfheim</i></a>, 
                <a href="#Vanaheim"><i>Vanaheim</i></a>, <a href="#Midgard"><i>Midgard</i></a>, <a href="#Musplheim"><i>Muspelheim</i></a>, <a href="#Niflheim"><i>Niflheim</i></a>, 
                <a href="#Jotunheim"><i>Jotunheim</i></a>, <a href="#Helheim"><i>Helheim</i></a>,  and <a href="#Svartalfheim"><i>Svartalfheim</i></a>. Each realm has its own different 
                creatures. Due to the lack of sources about the Norse Mythology, some of the realms are not described clearly nor even the position is provided, but we can still figure 
                out a lot from the poems written by <i>Snorri Sturluson</i>.
            </p>

            <section id="Asgard">
                <h2>Asgard</h2>
                <p>
                    Asgard is the realm where group of Gods called <a href="gods.html#aesir"><i><b>Aesir</b></i></a> lives. It is depicted as a beautiful place full of life and deities, 
                    surrounded by a great wall, and it should be placed at the top of the <i>Yggdrasil</i>. We can also find <a href="index.html#valhalla"><i>Valhalla</i></a>, 
                    the hall of fallen warriors, there. Asgard is connected to the <a href="#Midgard">Midgard</a> by the <i>Bifrost bridge</i> made of rainbow.

            <section id="Alfheim">
                <h2>Alfheim</h2>
                <p>
                    Alfheim is a land of <a href="index.html#elves"><b>elves</b></a>, both light and dark ones. It is not far from <a href="#Asgard">Asgard</a>, as it is still in heavens. However, the description of this realm is 
                    barely mentioned in the texts. We can assume there was a forest, because that is simply what elves prefer, and a beautiful nature, as the elves are 
                    famous for their beauty. 
                </p>

            <section id="Vanaheim">
                <h2>Vanaheim</h2>
                <p>
                    Vanaheim is another world that's appearance is not clear. We know that <a href="gods.html#vanir"><b><i>Vanir</i></b></a> live there and that it might be some kind of magical place due 
                    to <a href="gods.html#freya">Freya's</a> powers. And assuming that the <i>Vanir</i> are famous for their fertility abilities, the land should be rich of many different kinds of plants 
                    and animals.

            <section id="Midgard">
                <h2>Midgard</h2>
                <p>
                   Midgard (or the <i>Middle Earth</i>) is a place where <b>humans</b> live. It is surrounded by an ocean and <a href="index.html#jormungandr"><i>Jormungandr</i></a>. It is also protected by a wall, 
                   created from the eyelashes of the giant <i>Ymir</i>. That is because humans are very fragile and giants and other creatures would have no problem 
                   destroying them. It's first habitants were <i>Ask</i> and <i>Embla</i>, from which the whole humanity originates. However, the destiny of the Midgard is 
                   bounded to <a href="index.html#ragnarok"><i>Ragnarok</i></a>, as it should be destroyed. Its lands and seas will be poisoned. 
                </p>

            <section id="Muspelheim">
                <h2>Muspelheim</h2>
                <p>
                    Muspelheim is one of the first created realms, formed from a vast void <i>Ginnungagap</i>. It is a land of <b>fire</b>, that is ruled by a giant <i>Surtr</i>. Its position 
                    is definitely under the <a href="#Midgard">Midgard</a>, therefore somewhere near the bottom of <i>Yggdrasil</i>. There is basically nothing else but lava and flames. It is a home for 
                    the <b>fire giants</b> and <b>fire demons</b>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Niflheim is another of the first created realms - the land of <b>mist</b> and <b>cold</b>. However, <b>no one</b> lives there. It should have a place somewhere 
                    near the bottom of the <i>Yggdrasil</i>, as well as the <a href="#Muspelheim">Muspelheim</a>, but closer to the <a href="#Helheim">Helheim</a>.

            <section id="Jotunheim">
                <h2>Jotunheim</h2>
                <p>
                    A place close to both the <a href="#Asgard">Asgard</a> and the <a href="#Midgard">Midgard</a>. Jotunheim is a land of <b>giants</b>. It is depicted as a realm 
                    full of mountains and darkness without a fertile 
                    ground. However, there is a river that divides it from Asgard, that never freezes. Giants tend to fish there, as its their only source of food, apart from the 
                    forest animals. An interesting thing is, that <a href="gods.html#loki">Loki</a> was born/created there.

            <section id="Helheim">

                <p>
                    <i>The Realm of Hel</i>, also known as simply <i>Hel</i>, is an underworld, a place of <b>dead</b>, that are unworthy of <a href="index.html#valhalla"><i>Valhalla</i></a>. Its ruler is the Goddess <i>Hel</i> 
                    - a daughter of <a href="gods.html#loki">Loki</a>. Those, who end up 
                    in this dark cold place will never experience joy or happiness again. Its position is at the roots of <i>Yggdrasil</i>. To get there, one must cross a dangerous river full 
                    of weapons and proceed through the only gate present. There is no other way in, as it is surrounded by a huge wall.

                    Svartalfheim is the realms of <a href="index.html#dwarves"><b>dwarves</b></a>, the highly skilled craftsmen of the <i>Old World</i>. They live in mountains, caves or under the surface. Apart from 
                    them, there is nothing, just darkness, smoke from their forges, and sound of hammers or other equipment.

                My name is <i>Petra Petrusova</i> and I am an author of this website. I am from a small city in Slovakia and currently I am a Computer Science student 
                on <i>University College Cork</i> in Ireland. As you can see, my course is not related to the topic of this website, but I spent a lot of time 
                doing research on the Viking Age, as it is my favorite historic period. I have read a lot of stories and sagas, as well as encyclopedias and academic 
                texts.   
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole Mythology became my passion when I was on the primary school. My brother introduced me to the TV Series <i>Vikings</i> and I immediately 
                fell in love. Since then, I am constantly developing my knowledge, and the more I know, the more I find it interesting and beautiful. I still have 
                a lot of ground to cover, but I am already confident that this passion will stay with me throughout my whole life.
