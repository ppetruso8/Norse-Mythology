                    <h3>Creation of the World</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before the world as we know was created, there was nothing but pure void called <b><i lang="non">Ginnungagap</i></b>, from which 
                        <a href="nine_worlds.html#Niflheim"><i>Niflheim</i></a> and <a href="nine_worlds.html#Muspelheim"><i>Muspelheim</i></a> were formed. Niflheim 
                        became a land of ice and Muspelheim a land of fire. 
                        In the middle of <i lang="non" class="normal">Ginnungagap</i> both lands met and while the fire was melting ice, the first giant was created - <i>Ymir</i>. 
                        From his sweat and leg a family of frost giants was formed. They were fed by a giant cow, that later found <i>Buri</i> inside the ice block, 
                        that she was licking. Buri is the giant, but also the <b>first God</b>. With his wife he would have three sons - 
                        <a href="gods.html#odin"><i>Odin</i></a>, <i>Vili</i>, and <i>Ve</i>. However, his sons were unhappy with the fact that there were only three 
                        of them and the number 
                        of giants was constantly growing, so they decided to kill Ymir. But it wasn't that easy. A whole war began, but they managed to kill Ymir. 
                        Most of the giants drowned in blood, that was flowing out of his body and only two survived and escaped.

                        The hair became the grass and trees. The eyelashes became <a href="nine_worlds.html#Midgard">Midgard</a>. They threw the brain up in the air 
                        and it became the clouds, and the skull became the sky, Ymir’s skull would be the lid that covered the new world. The brothers grabbed some 
                        of the sparks shooting out from Muspelheim, the land of fire. They threw the sparks up toward the inside of the skull, these sparks gleamed 
                        at night and this is what we call the stars." (<i>Skjalden</i>, 2011).

                    <p>
                        Ragnarok is the <b>destruction</b> of all of the worlds and everything that is present in the Mythology. All vikings were familiar with the 
                        fate of the world and they were actively preparing for it during their stay in <a href="#valhalla">Valhalla</a>. The whole process of 
                        Ragnarok is depicted as a cruel, almost never-ending winter with no sun and stars, during which would all evil creatures rise to attack the Gods, 
                        who would die. In this enormous chaos, the earth would sink into the sea and almost everything is lost, but not forever. After everything is settled, 
                        the earth will rise again. Surprisingly, there are a few survivors - 3 Gods, son of <a href="gods.html#thor">Thor</a> and daughter of the God Sol. 
                        They would start building the world again, together with the God <a href="gods.html#baldur">Baldur</a>, who would come back from the underworld. The fallen 
                        ones should be together in a great hall with golden roof.

                    <h3>Mythical creatures</h3>
                    <p>
                        Apart from the giants that were mentioned before, the Norse Mythology is full of different magical or beast-like creatures. Here is the 
                        introduction to a few of the main ones.
                    </p>

                        <h4>Dwarves</h4>
                        <p>
                            Dwarves were created from worms, that were crawling out of the dead giant <i>Ymir</i>. Four of them, called <i lang="non">Nordi</i>, 
                            <i lang="non">Vestri</i>, <i lang="non">Sundri</i> and <i lang="non">Austri</i> (after cardinal directions), were told to hold up the 
                            sky at four different directions of the world. The rest went to the <a href="nine_worlds.html#Svartalfheim"><i>Svartalfheim</i></a>, 
                            which is place near the bottom of the world. They live there in caves or under the ground, and they are visited by other creatures (mostly Gods)
                            who are seeking their skills. Their role in the <i>Old World</i> was for crafting weapons, armor, jewelry, etc. Without them, 
                            <a href="gods.html#thor">Thor</a> would not have his <i>Mjolnir</i>, <a href="gods.html#odin">Odin</a> his <i>Gungnir</i>, and 
                            many other creatures would miss their iconic, necessary equipment.

                            Beautiful tall creatures, that almost didn't interact with humans - Elves. Their role was mainly as healers, but even that did not 
                            happen very often. They were ruled by the God Freyr and were divided into two groups, to which we could refer as to "good and evil", or "light and dark".

                        <p>
                            Another beautiful creatures - the last thing men saw on the battle ground after being covered in blood and on the edge of life. Valkyries were female 
                            characters who served <a href="gods.html#odin">Odin</a>. Their role was to decide whether the fallen ones are worthy to continue their life journey in 
                            <a href="#valhalla"><i>Valhalla</i></a>, who will go to <a href="nine_worlds.html#Helheim">Hel</a>, or who will remain amongst the living. They also protected 
                            humans on their travels. Being able to fly certainly helped them accomplish these tasks. Apart from that, they cared for worthy fallen ones - they 
                            poured mead, healed wounds, and brought men back on their feet. That is also why they sometimes appear as their lovers. They were often accompanied 
                            by ravens, swans, or horses.

                            He broke out from the chains, that were created by the other Gods and dwarves to protect the world, and he bit off hand of the God 
                            <a href="gods.html#tyr">Tyr</a> after his unsuccessful attempt to tame him.

                        <p>
                            <i>The Midnight Serpent</i> is another child of <a href="gods.html#loki">Loki</a>. At first, he was living in the 
                            <a href="nine_worlds.html#Jotunheim"><i>Jotunheim</i></a> wtih his siblings and mother, but <a href="gods.html#odin">Odin</a> removed him and 
                            threw him deep into the ocean (due to his movements, the tidal waves and sea storms were happening), so he would not do any harm to anyone. 
                            However, he grew in size so much, he could encircle the whole world of humans while biting his own tail. <b>Thanks to him, the whole 
                            <a href="#ragnarok"><i>Ragnarok</i></a> began</b> - he let go of his tail, came out of the ocean and poisoned the sky. In the stories we can see him fighting twice 
                            with <a href="gods.html#thor">Thor</a>. First time, when the God is trying to fish him so he would slain him with his <i>Mjolnir</i>. He used 
                            the head of a giant ox as a bait, but he is stopped by an accompanied giant <i>Hymir</i>, who is scared that the boat will sink and that this 
                            act would bring the end to the world. Second time they meet during the Ragnarok, where they both die during their fight. However, the text from 
                            <i>Prose Edda</i> is more inclined to the version, in which the serpent was not killed and is still hidden in the depth of the ocean.

                My name is <i>Petra Petrusova</i> and I am an author of this website. I am from a small city in Slovakia and currently I am a Computer Science student 
                on <i>University College Cork</i> in Ireland. As you can see, my course is not related to the topic of this website, but I spent a lot of time 
                doing research on the Viking Age, as it is my favorite historic period. I have read a lot of stories and sagas, as well as encyclopedias and academic 
                texts.   
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole Mythology became my passion when I was on the primary school. My brother introduced me to the TV Series <i>Vikings</i> and I immediately 
                fell in love. Since then, I am constantly developing my knowledge, and the more I know, the more I find it interesting and beautiful. I still have 
                a lot of ground to cover, but I am already confident that this passion will stay with me throughout my whole life.
